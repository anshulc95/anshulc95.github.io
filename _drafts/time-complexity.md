This is a test `from m import x` vs {% ihighlight python %} from random
import random {% endihighlight %}

```python
from random import random
import sys
import platform


print(f"Python {sys.version}")
print(platform.platform())
print(platform.processor())
```

    Python 3.6.9 (default, Oct  8 2020, 12:12:24)

1. draw plot of showing the 

    1.1 $$O(1)$$ getting a value from a list

    1.2 $$O(n)$$, summing up a list of int using for loop

    1.3 $$O(n^2)$$ for loop with a for loop
2. refer multiple books on how to find Big O of an expression
3. What is lograrithms
4. What is $$O(\log n)$$ and $$O(n\log n)$$


```python

```
