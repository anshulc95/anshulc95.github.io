- What does "time-complexity" mean?

- what is the meaning of asymptotic notation?
    - What is asymptotic

1. draw plot of showing the 

    1.1 $$O(1)$$ getting a value from a list

    1.2 $$O(n)$$, summing up a list of int using for loop

    1.3 $$O(n^2)$$ for loop with a for loop
2. refer multiple books on how to find Big O of an expression
3. What is a logarithm
4. What is $$O(\log n)$$ and $$O(n\log n)$$
