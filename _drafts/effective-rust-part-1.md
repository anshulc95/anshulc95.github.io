I decided to write this post in an effort to learn Rust. So if you see any issues
in my post feel free to email me at <b>anshulchauhan@outlook.com</b> .

I am a Python developer, so I chose Brett Slatkin's [Effective Python](https://effectivepython.com)
for inspiration. This post is based on code examples in his GitHub repository at
[github.com/bslatkin/effectivepython](https://github.com/bslatkin/effectivepython/tree/master/example_code).

## Know Which Rust you're using

```
rustc --version
rustc 1.52.1 (9bc8c42bb 2021-05-09)
```
